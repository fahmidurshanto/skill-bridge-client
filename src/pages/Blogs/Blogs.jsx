          What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and where
          should we store them on the client-side?

              <span className="font-bold text-2xl">Access Token</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                An access token is a credential that is used to access protected
                resources. It is typically a string of characters representing
                the user's authorization to access specific resources on a
                server. The access token is usually short-lived, meaning it has
                a limited lifetime (often ranging from minutes to an hour).
              </span>
              <br />
              <span className="font-bold underline">How it works:</span>
              <br />
              <span className="font-bold">Client Request: </span>
              The client (e.g., a web or mobile app) requests an access token by
              providing valid credentials (like a username and password) to an
              authorization server.
              <br />
              <span className="font-bold">Token Issuance: </span>
              The authorization server validates the credentials and issues an
              access token to the client.
              <br />
              <span className="font-bold">Resource Access: </span>
              The client includes the access token in the headers of HTTP
              requests to access protected resources on the resource server.
              <br />
              <span className="font-bold">Validation: </span>
              The resource server validates the access token to ensure it is
              valid and not expired. If valid, the resource server grants access
              to the requested resources.
            </p>
          </div>
          {/* refresh token */}
          <div>
            <p className="p-5">
              <span className="font-bold text-2xl">Refresh Token</span>
              <br />
              <span>
                A refresh token is a credential used to obtain a new access
                token without needing to re-authenticate the user. Unlike the
                access token, the refresh token is typically long-lived (it can
                last for days, weeks, or even months).
              </span>
              <br />
              <span className="font-bold underline">How it works:</span>
              <br />
              <span className="font-bold">Token Request: </span>
              When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh
              token to request a new access token from the authorization server.
              <br />
              <span className="font-bold">Token Issuance: </span>
              The authorization server verifies the refresh token and issues a
              new access token (and possibly a new refresh token).
              <br />
              <span className="font-bold">Continued Access: </span>
              The client uses the new access token to continue accessing
              protected resources.
            </p>

            <span className="font-bold text-2xl">Storage on Client-Side</span>
            <br />
            <span>
              Storing tokens securely on the client-side is crucial to prevent
              unauthorized access and potential security breaches. Hereâ€™s where
              and how you should store them:
            </span>
            <br />
            <span className="font-bold underline">Access Token:</span>
            <br />
            <span className="font-bold">
              Web Applications (Single Page Applications - SPAs):{" "}
            </span>
            Store access tokens in memory (JavaScript variables). This approach
            limits the exposure of the token, as it is not persisted beyond the
            page refresh.
            <br />
            <span className="font-bold">Pros: </span>
            Reduces risk of token theft from persistent storage.
            <br />
            <span className="font-bold">Cons: </span>
            Token is lost on page refresh, which requires re-authentication or
            using the refresh token.
          </p>
          <div>
            <span className="font-bold underline">Refresh Token:</span>
            <br />
            <span className="font-bold">Web Applications: </span>
            Store refresh tokens in HttpOnly cookies. This type of cookie is not
            accessible via JavaScript, which helps mitigate XSS (Cross-Site
            Scripting) attacks.
            <br />
            <span className="font-bold">Pros: </span>
            Increased security against XSS.
            <br />
            <span className="font-bold">Cons: </span>
            Still vulnerable to CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) if not
            properly protected.
          </div>
          <div>
            <span className="font-bold text-2xl">Best Practices</span>
            <br />
            <span className="font-bold">Use HTTPS:</span>
            Always use HTTPS to encrypt the transmission of tokens.
            <br />
            <span className="font-bold"> Token Expiry:</span>
            Ensure access tokens have a short expiry time to limit their
            exposure if compromised.
            <br />
            <span className="font-bold">Token Scope: </span>
            Minimize the scope of access tokens to the least privileges
            required.
            <br />
            <span className="font-bold">Secure Storage:</span>
            Use platform-specific secure storage solutions for storing tokens.
            <br />
            <span className="font-bold"> Invalidate Tokens: </span>
            Provide a mechanism to invalidate tokens (e.g., logout
            functionality).{" "}
